Sesame Examples
---------------

The structure of these examples is borrowed directly from the very clear examples in the [dream](https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example) repository.

If an example directory has a prefix `s` this means it is "pure Sesame", `cs` means "OCurrent sesame". Most of the skills you learn from `s-*` are directly translatable to OCurrent versions.
